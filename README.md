# typing-freak-console

My first ever useful C++ program. Back in the dark old days when I used to think OOP and field accessors are a good idea, that's how old this program is.

- TypingFreak is a typing program to practice typing. You could write your own text and practice typing it.

- Before Typing, you should set the name of your source file.

- If you have the sourct text file in another directory (not in the same folder that has the exe)
then you should type the whole absolute path. Otherwise, just the file name (with or without the .txt)

- Timing will start from the very first right/wrong letter you type.

- There will be a report after each round including: CPS, WPM, NumberOfMistakes, NumberOfCharactersInFile, NumberOfWordsInFile,
Correctness & Mistake Percentage...

- There will be a Report file storing all your reports with their dates, so that you could compare
your self with previous time and see whether or not you've improved your typing skills.

- Exit typing by pressing ctrl + z.
